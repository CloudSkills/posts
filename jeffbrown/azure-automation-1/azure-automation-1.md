### Introduction

Azure Automation is a cloud-based automation and configuration service that can be

In this guide, you will set up your an Azure Automation Account and deploy your first PowerShell runbook. When you're finished, you will have the necessary skills to get started deploying runbooks in your Azure tenant.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this guide you'll need the following:

- Azure tenant and subscription
- Administrator account with sufficient permissions on a subscription, such as Owner or Contributor
- PowerShell knowledge

## Create an Azure Automation Account

Before creating your first runbook, you need to create an Azure Automation Account. This account is responsible for executing runbooks and authenticating to any Azure resources the runbook needs access to. The account groups together Automation resources, runbooks, and configuration settings. You can create multiple accounts to separate their functionality, such as accounts for development and production.

To get started creating your first Azure Automation Account, log into the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com). In the Search bar, enter Azure Automation, and select Automation Accounts from the results.

Here in the Automation Accounts resource page, you can view and manage any existing Automation Accounts. Click on **+ Add** to create your Automation Account. In the **Add Automation Account** page, you need to define some information for your account:

- **Name**: Enter a description name for the account. Following Microsoft recommendations, I will name mine based on the resource type, its purpose, environment, Azure region, and instance. For example, aa-cloudskills-prod-westus-001.
- **Subscription**: Select a valid Azure subscription.
- **Resource Group**: Select an existing resource group or create a new one. For this demo, I am creating a new resource group named *azacct-rg*.
- **Location**: Select a location to host the Automation Account.
- **Create Azure Run As account**: Enabling this option will automatically create an Azure Run As account for authenticating to other Azure resources. For now, configure this to **Yes**.

![Creating the Automation Account](./images/add-automation-account-wizard.png)

Once the account information has been entered, click on **Create**. Once the account has been created successfully, select the account in the Automation Account list (this may require a refresh before it appears).

## Create the PowerShell Runbook

Now that they Automation Account has been created, you can create the runbook that hosts your PowerShell code. In the Automation Account resource using the left menu, scroll down to **Process Automation** and select **Runbooks**. Here you will see some example of each type of runbook you can create: Graphical, Python, and PowerShell. You can view each of these runbooks to learn how to perform different actions in runbooks, such as using variable or connecting to Azure resources. You can also import a runbook or browse the PowerShell Gallery and Azure Automation GitHub organization for resources created by Microsoft and the community.

![Viewing automation runbooks](./images/view-runbooks.png)

Let's get started creating a runbook by select **+ Create a runbook**. In the form, enter a runbook name, select the runbook type, and enter a description. This demo will be using a PowerShell runbook type. Once the information has been entered, select the **Create** button.

![Creating a runbook](./images/create-runbook-config.png)

When the runbook is created, the Azure portal should redirect you to the **Edit PowerShell Runbook** page. This page is where you can enter in the PowerShell code that the Automation Account executes. The menu actions include the ability to save the runbook, publish a new version of the runbook, revert to a previously published version, or run a test of the runbook. On the left, you can view the modules and cmdlets available to use in the runbook, import references to other runbooks, or view assets that you can use in the script, such as variables or certificates for authentication.

![Edit PowerShell runbook](./images/edit-powershell-runbook.png)

For this runbook, I am keeping the code simple and displaying the phrase "Hello, Azure Runbooks!" to the console.

```powershell
"Hello, Azure Runbooks!"
```

Once you have entered the code, select the **Save** button, then the **Publish** button. You will receive a warning that publishing the runbook will override the existing published version. Select **Yes** to this prompt. Once the runbook is successfully published, the Azure portal will redirect to the **Overview** page.

## Execute the Runbook

With the runbook created and published, you can now execute the runbook and view the output. From the **Overview** page, select the **Start** icon. It will prompt you to make sure you want to start the runbook, go ahead and select **Yes**. Once the runbook has been execute, the portal will redirect to the overview page for this runbook job instance. Here you can view the instance ID, the status, and the input and output streams of the runbook. From here, select the **Output** tab to view the "Hello, Azure Runbooks!" message to the console.

<!-- When showing a command, explain the command first by talking about what it does. Then show the command. Then show its output in a separate output block: -->

Display the status of your firewall with the following command:

```command
sudo ufw status

You'll see the following output:

```

<!-- When asking the reader to open a file, specify the file and show the command to open it: -->

Open the file `/etc/nginx.conf` in your editor:

```command
sudo nano /etc/nginx.com

<!-- When showing a configuration file, try to show only the relevant parts and explain what needs to change.  -->

Change the `root` field so it points to `/var/www/your_domain`:

```nginx
[label /etc/nginx/sites-available/default]
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;

    root <^>/var/www/your_domain<^>;
    index index.html index.htm;

    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}

Here's a command someone types in the Terminal:

```command
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

Here's a configuration file. 

The label on the first line lets you clearly state the file that's being shown or modified:

```nginx
